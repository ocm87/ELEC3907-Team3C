Some notes for the creation of the enclosure for the Arduino and battery pack

Need CAD Design of the model with standoffs for the arduino.

Preerably a hole so that Arduino software can be updated while it's inside the enclosure 
without having to remove it

Openings for sensors and anteanae for GPS and Wifi module
