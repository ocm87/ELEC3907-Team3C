## Current Project Status:

### General: 
- Sensor data gathering and wireless connectivity + Flask web server

### Software: 
Updated March 2.
- SOS Functionality working via web request and button. Button code is integrated. Added GET /sensor/all endpoint for all sensor data and will add button.
- Writing Python parser to interpret back into dictionary.
- Getting Basic Wifi Functionality updated for Arduino via HTTP request (going with plain text and python parser)
- Formatting HTTP request response (formatting function)
- LAMP webserver setup on Raspberry Pi (Flask Based)
- Added Remote enable/disable for the SOS function, with Python and the Arduino based code

### Hardware:
Updated Feb 14.
- Sensor Testing
- What kind of values are we getting out of each sensor?
- button debouncing for SOS functionality

### Integration:
- Sensor Testing
- Needed Libraries?
